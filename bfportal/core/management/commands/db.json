more effectively 3 To improve teamplay and strategy along with effective use of gadgets The various special objectives are as follows and will be different from map to map In game messages will help you understand the special objectives in each map 1 Satellite Controlling hostile satellite will allow your team to breach the satellite intel and provide enemy coordinates at a specific frequency This is set at 2 sec spotting at 30 second intervals 2 Ammo Cache Controlling hostile ammo cache will restrict enemy from calling in Angel s loadout drop Equip standard ammo crates or use enemy loadout drops to top off ammo 3 Vehicle Repair Depot Controlling hostile vehicle repair depot will max out enemy vehicles at 80 armor Try keeping those vehicles topped off using the repair tool 4

WW2 set mode where two teams fight for a main objective with a large capture radius its usually a town or somewhere fun to fight Within the main objective there is a priority area that moves around

you introduce a ticket bleed Every time a human player dies their team loses a ticket The first team to run out of tickets loses just like conquest Each team also has an outpost that if captured allows for a paradrop closer to the main objective You can neutralise your enemy s outpost but you cannot take it for yourself To win you must hold the main objective This mode was inspired by Sa
