If you already have experience with django/wagtail, understanding the backend will be really easy for you.

> **Note**
> If you are just starting it is highly recommended to learn about the structure of a [django project](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/). and [wagtail project](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html)

> Learn wagtail first :)

# Development Environment Setup

## Containerized Setup

### Prerequisites

You need to install the following applications on your system

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NodeJS / npm package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

### Setup

- Create a Python Virtual Environment and activate it
  ```
  py -m venv ./python-venvs/bfportal
  ./python-venvs/bfportal/Scripts/activate
  ```
- Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for dependency management
  ```
  curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
  ```
- Install python dependencies
  ```
  cd bfportal.gg
  poetry install
  ```
- Install the pre-commit hooks by running
  ```
  pre-commit install --install-hooks
  ```
- Install npm dependencies
  ```
  cd bfportal.gg/bfportal
  npm install
  ```
- Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env`
- (optional) Create a [discord application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) for OAuth2 and copy the client id and secret
  - Paste the client id and secret in `.env` file to `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `DISCORD_SECRET` respectively
- From the repositories root directory build the necessary docker images and run the platform
  ```
  docker-compose --profile dev_local up
  ```
- The website should become available at `127.0.0.1:8000`

## Non-Container Environment Setup

### Python

- Refer to [readme.md](/README.md#how-to-run-locally)
- install pre-commit checks by running (**make sure the Virtual Enviroment is activated !!**)
  ```
  pre-commit install
  ```

### NodeJs

- Make sure [npmjs](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) is installed in system, if the path to npm binary is not available in \$PATH variable define `NPM_BIN_PATH` in [`settings/base.py`](/bfportal/bfportal/settings/base.py#L75) accordingly
- Install TailwindCSS (only required if you are contributing to the frontend)
  ```
  python manage.py tailwind install --no-input
  ```
- Start TailwindCSS in watch mode
  ```
  python manage.py tailwind start
  ```

### Postgres

- Make sure postgres is installed and running
- Create DB, USER and Password for the project
- Update the `.env` file accordingly

The backend is made up of Four django Apps.

```
bfportal/
    bfportal (Global App)
    core (Content Server)
    factory (Fake data generation)
    theme (tailwind manager)
```

# Django Apps

| App      | Description                                                                                                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bfportal | This app Contains the base settings and base html file that is used to generate any webpage on the website             |
| core     | The app is the heart of "Experience listing" and User profile, all the models used in the Database are defined in this |
| factory  | Is an app that is used to generate fake data to help while developing the project locally                              |
| theme    | This app is used to manage TailwindCSS integration with Django (start and upgrading)                                   |

# Few key components

- All the "webpages" are in `<app>/<templates>/<app>/` directory, we can use this structure to override the template of other apps that are installed in python
- The models for all "pages" type are defined in [`/core/models/*`](/bfportal/core/models)
- The API at (https://api.bfportal.gg/) is defined and controlled by [`/core/api.py`](/bfportal/core/api.py)
- Form validation and discord hooks are done in [`/core/views.py`](/bfportal/core/views.py)
